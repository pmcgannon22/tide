#### Google Wave's little, tiny brother. 

##### Set up

- Install **node.js**
- Install **npm**, a node package manager. 
- In main directory (where *package.json* resides), run *npm install*.

Now, all dependencies should be installed in a folder called *node_modules*. 

In main directory, run *node server.js*. This should start the server. Navigate to **localhost:1337**.
